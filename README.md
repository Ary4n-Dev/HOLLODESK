# 🖐️ HolloDesk — AI-Powered Virtual Whiteboard

[<h3 href="https://hollodesk.web.app/">Hollodesk</h3>](https://hollodesk.web.app/)

**HolloDesk** is a browser-based AI-powered whiteboard that lets you **write, draw, pan, and erase in the air** using just your webcam — no touch or stylus required!  
Built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, HolloDesk uses **computer vision hand tracking** to detect gestures and map your hand movements into real-time drawing actions.

## 🌐 Live Concept

When you land on the webpage:
1. The **camera starts automatically**, filling the background with a live video feed.  
2. An **85% opaque overlay** appears on top — this is your **virtual writing area**.  
3. A **bottom toolbar** appears with:
   - 3 **pen tools** of different colors.
   - **Background selection options** — solid color, ruled page, or Cartesian grid.
4. **Hand gestures control everything**:
   - ✋ **Open palm (5 fingers)** → Eraser mode.  
   - ☝️ **Single finger (index)** → Write or draw.  
   - 🤟 **Three fingers** → Pan or move the writing area.

Everything runs directly in your browser — **no backend, no install, no data upload**.
